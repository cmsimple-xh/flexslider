Writing Permissions
===================
If you usually have to give writing permissions to files,
you will have to give writing permission (folder + files) to 

plugins/flexslider/languages/
plugins/flexslider/config/ 
userfiles/plugins/flexslider/

In php version 5.3 or less with
*** save_mode=on ***
the plugin cannot create writable folders.
However the plugin comes with all necessary folders. So after
having given writing permissions, it should work ok.
