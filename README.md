Flexslider Plugin for CMSimple_XH
=================================

Due to lack of time [svasti](http://svasti.de/) is currently unable to maintain
the Flexslider plugin. As *provisional* *solution* it has therefore been decided
to put the plugin here, so that the CMSimple_XH developers are able to do the
necessary maintenance (at least do some odd fixes), and release new versions
from time to time.
